# Portfolio Website - Script-Based Management

This portfolio website has been refactored from Docker containers to custom scripts for both development and production environments. This provides greater flexibility, better performance, and easier maintenance.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Development Mode
```bash
# Check dependencies
./scripts/check-dependencies.sh

# Start development environment
./scripts/portfolio.sh dev

# Or use individual scripts
./scripts/dev.sh          # Start Strapi + Eleventy
./scripts/build-dev.sh    # Build for local testing
./scripts/logs.sh         # View logs
./scripts/stop.sh         # Stop servers
```

### Production Mode
```bash
# Initial setup (run once)
sudo ./scripts/setup-prod.sh

# Start production services
./scripts/start-prod.sh

# Or use the management interface
./scripts/portfolio.sh manage
```

## üìã Architecture Overview

### Components
- **Strapi CMS** (v5.13.0) - Backend content management
- **Eleventy** - Static site generator
- **Nginx** - Web server and reverse proxy
- **Webhook Server** - Automatic rebuilds on content changes
- **SSL/TLS** - Let's Encrypt certificates for HTTPS

### Data Flow
1. Content is managed in Strapi CMS
2. Eleventy pulls data from Strapi API to build static site
3. Nginx serves static files and proxies admin requests
4. Webhook triggers rebuilds when content changes
5. SSL certificates are automatically renewed

## üîß Development Workflow

### Daily Development
1. Start development environment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/portfolio.sh dev
   ```

2. Access your sites:
   - Strapi API: http://127.0.0.1:1337/api
   - Strapi Admin: http://127.0.0.1:1337/admin
   - Eleventy Site: http://127.0.0.1:8080

3. View logs:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/logs.sh
   ```

4. Stop when done:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop.sh
   ```

### Testing Builds
```bash
# Build for testing
./scripts/build-dev.sh

# Build and serve locally
./scripts/build-dev.sh serve

# Clean build files
./scripts/build-dev.sh clean
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### Initial Setup
1. **System Setup** (run once):
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/setup-prod.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Edit production configuration
   nano config.prod.env
   
   # Set up environment
   ./scripts/env-setup.sh prod
   ```

3. **Setup SSL Certificates**:
   ```bash
   # If you have existing certificates, they'll be detected
   # Otherwise, obtain new certificates:
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d admin.yourdomain.com
   ```

### Deployment
```bash
# Start production services
./scripts/start-prod.sh

# Check status
./scripts/manage.sh status

# View logs
./scripts/manage.sh logs
```

### Ongoing Management
```bash
# Monitor system health
./scripts/monitor.sh check

# Create backups
./scripts/backup.sh

# Update SSL certificates
./scripts/manage.sh ssl-update
```

## üîç Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Monitoring
The monitoring system checks:
- System resources (CPU, memory, disk)
- Service health (Strapi, webhook, nginx)
- Database integrity
- SSL certificate validity
- Website accessibility
- Log file analysis
- Performance metrics

### Automatic Tasks
- **SSL Renewal**: Certificates are renewed automatically
- **Log Rotation**: Logs are rotated to prevent disk overflow
- **Backup Cleanup**: Old backups are removed automatically
- **Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring available

### Backup Strategy
- **Full Backups**: Database, uploads, configuration, SSL certificates
- **Incremental**: Database and configuration only
- **Retention**: 30 days (configurable)
- **Compression**: Automatic with tar.gz
- **Restoration**: One-command restore process

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services won't start:**
```bash
# Check dependencies
./scripts/check-dependencies.sh

# Check logs
./scripts/logs.sh

# Check system resources
./scripts/monitor.sh system
```

**Build failures:**
```bash
# Validate environment
./scripts/build-prod.sh validate

# Check Strapi connectivity
curl http://127.0.0.1:1337/api

# Clean and rebuild
./scripts/build-dev.sh clean
./scripts/build-dev.sh
```

**SSL issues:**
```bash
# Check certificate status
./scripts/monitor.sh ssl

# Renew certificates
sudo ./scripts/manage.sh ssl-update

# Test nginx configuration
sudo ./scripts/nginx-config.sh test
```

### Log Locations
- **Development**: `./logs/`
- **Production**: `./logs/` and `/var/log/nginx/`
- **System**: `/var/log/` (systemd journals)

### Getting Help
```bash
# Interactive help menu
./scripts/portfolio.sh

# Detailed help
./scripts/portfolio.sh help

# Script-specific help
./scripts/<script-name>.sh --help
```

## üîÑ Migration from Docker

If migrating from the Docker setup:

1. **Stop Docker containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. **Backup existing data**:
   ```bash
   cp -r strapi-data ./backups/
   cp -r nginx/certbot ./backups/
   ```

3. **Run dependency check**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-dependencies.sh
   ```

4. **Start with development**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/portfolio.sh dev
   ```

5. **For production, run setup**:
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/setup-prod.sh
   ```

The scripts will automatically detect and use existing data files and SSL certificates.
