- ✅ Tested environment setup and configuration
- ✅ Verified migration compatibility
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

## 🛠 Complete Script Toolkit

The refactor created a comprehensive toolkit of 13 management scripts:

### Core Management
- `portfolio.sh` - Main entry point with interactive menu
- `env-setup.sh` - Environment detection and configuration
- `check-dependencies.sh` - System dependency validation

### Development Workflow
- `dev.sh` - Development server management
- `build-dev.sh` - Development build system
- `logs.sh` - Development log viewing
- `stop.sh` - Stop development servers

### Production Management  
- `setup-prod.sh` - Production environment setup
- `start-prod.sh` - Production service startup
- `manage.sh` - Production management interface
- `build-prod.sh` - Production build pipeline
- `webhook-prod.sh` - Webhook and rebuild management

### Configuration & Maintenance
- `nginx-config.sh` - Nginx configuration management
- `backup.sh` - Comprehensive backup system
- `monitor.sh` - System monitoring and health checks

## 🔧 System Architecture
